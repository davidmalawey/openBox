## Organizers & Tools
Designs for holding your toos & equipment & securing them where needed.

Overview of some tool holders made with HandyBox, for custom fitment of various round shank sizes.

Use the box with a magnet (designed for unistrut assemblies) for storing within reach.

The spacing in back of the box aligns with ordinary 1x1 inch pegboard

Or, fasten the box to a composite pegboard with the compatible screws, and still reach the fastener when the openbox is loaded.

## AC Electrical
For 120v or 240v appliances with custom wires or switches

Design your own electronics box, as usual with 3d printing but use standard parts!

Switches with 22mm circle snap right into place.

## Embedded Electronics
We will feature arduino & other MCU based projects but here's the start, with a project for car adapter & embedded power control found in a PD adapter.

**Pictures coming soon!**

## DC Power

The Car Adapter converts a power tool battery to a cigarette lighter socket.  It includes a simple cover (panel) and the handy bushing (3D Printed)

## Cable Routing

The handy bushing design holds a wire or a plug in place, such as Anderson Powerwerx connectors.   It was designed by benchmarking the similar off-the-shelf designs.  The OTS bushings work great but we gain custom features by making our own.
