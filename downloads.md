You can find OpenBox-related CAD files by searching [“OpenBox” on GrabCAD](https://grabcad.com/library?page=1&time=all_time&sort=recent&query=openbox) and also on [Thangs](https://thangs.com/designer/bmeunier/collection/OpenBox-97771). Among the results, you’ll discover the original contributions by David Malawey, which include detailed CAD models and essential designs for the OpenBox project. These files serve as the foundation for the project, offering users a reliable starting point for building or customizing their own versions of the OpenBox.

In addition to the original contributions, GrabCAD also features various remixes and adaptations created by the global community. These include innovative modifications, such as HandyBox designs compatible with other countries’ standards, and other creative uses tailored to specific needs.

**Models based on RACO no.666**
This library is part of the HandyBox collection, featuring replicas of the RCO #666 Electrical Box. This widely available component, found in hardware stores across the United States, is specifically designed to be compatible with the OpenBox ecosystem. Along with the CAD files, the library includes data sheets and technical drawings, providing precise dimensions and detailed specifications. These resources ensure accuracy for seamless integration into your projects and offer valuable insights for customization or adaptation to various applications.

**eBushing**
This bushing adapts a hole in a panel wall for a connector. It is parametric & the first set of features serves the anderson connector pair, great for power electronics. I called it eBushing for electronics, where the parent model may be later used for mechanical features, but in such a case we will change the compliant design to a different type of fitment, which offers more concentricity to the hole.

## Canadian-Spec
* CAD library for canadian parts designs 
* This library is a remix of the original OpenBox project by David Malawey, adapted for the Canadian version of the HandyBox. While the technical requirements closely resemble the original HandyBox designed for the U.S. market, specific differences exist, resulting in slight variations in design. The aim of this library is to replicate key components from David Malawey’s original work, creating a strong foundation for future modifications and applications.
