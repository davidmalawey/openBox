# Design
The purpose of Handybox is to benefit several types of projects with one standard part, accompanied by several other standards that have a well-established ecosystem and many available components near you at brick-and-mortar stores.
I Hope you benefit from the concepts here - even without building any handybox designs you will find some techniques that save time in CAD, prototyping, wiring, or creating new concepts for designs.

# Videos
To be populated from my youtube videos soon.

# Parts
Components, methods, and considerations for organizing wires in projects.  It's best to watch this before you design, so you can discover parts to integrate in your project plans.

## Main Parts
Main components around which the other parts are designed.

* EMT Conduit
* Handybox electrical boxes with 1/2in knockout holes
* Switches, 22mm, toggle switches
* Outlets, ordinary 120v North America standard
