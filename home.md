## Home
This website is made for the OpenBox 3D Printable Electrical Box project!  Everyone is invited to use these designs or contribute to this design on GitHub.  Design data will be posted on grabCAD.com starting with [handybox](https://grabcad.com/library/handybox-1) and ongoing continually.

Here's just one video lesson of many to come:

## How to participate
_benefit & help out with our community project!_

### Explore
If you don't like reading, just hop onto grabCAD and jump into the designs!  Also see the [image gallery](gallery.md) but be aware it may contain only a portion of the designs.

### Contribute
There are no rules!  But here's an invitation to help in the best ways: As with all of my open projects my aim is to initiate but not to create all outcomes.  As I build modules that support my electronics teaching, robotics, and so on I invite others to create items from their imagination & share them as well.  Every author can decide their own path.  I prefer to share on GrabCAD but Printables and other sites are great too.  Github is not highly popular among mechanical designers but it's great for documentation so I invite you to comment as a github user, join the project as a collaborator, or post an issue as a user that can centralize the needs for ongoing development!  

I also will continue posting related items on my youtube (david malawey) so users can see the possibilities.

## Electrical
Suitable 3D printed designs for openBox can enable your electronics projects & build robustness. New modules will be continually released such as button mounts, DIN brackets, and other electrical integrations.

## Mechanical
_mechanical features & designs_
The heavy steel stamping is a perfect starting point for many mechanical designs.  Over time, we will feature static figures such as customizable camera mounts, pivoting structures, attachments for parts storage, and dynamic assemblies (you could even call them robots).

### Interfacing


## Data:
_data to support engineering & development_

![image techsheet](img/img_racoData1.jpg 'class=image-25')
_technical sheets published by manufacturers_

![img_drawing](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/256211c1-f47f-49f2-863e-14f5fdbfc8e6)
_dimensional drawings by manufacturers (Raco & more)_

We don't have a specific structure for posting data but as I accumulate useful drawings and reliable documentation behind the branded boxes (such as Raco by Hubbel) I will upload the content for others to download.  At times, I markup a PDF with mechanical drawings to point out the key items instead of starting a document from scratch.
