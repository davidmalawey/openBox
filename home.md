This website is made for the OpenBox 3D Printable Electrical Box project!  Everyone is invited to contribute to this design on GitHub.

## How to participate
As with all of my open projects my aim is to initiate but not to create all outcomes.  As I build modules that support my electronics teaching, robotics, and so on I invite others to create items from their imagination & share them as well.  Every author can decide their own path.  I prefer to share on GrabCAD but Printables and other sites are great too.  Github is not highly popular among mechanical designers but it's great for documentation so I invite you to comment as a github user, join the project as a collaborator, or post an issue as a user that can centralize the needs for ongoing development!  

I also will continue posting related items on my youtube (david malawey) so users can see the possibilities.

## Electrical:
Suitable 3D printed designs for openBox can enable your electronics projects & build robustness. New modules will be continually released such as button mounts, DIN brackets, and other electrical integrations.

## Mechanical:
The heavy steel stamping is a perfect starting point for many mechanical designs.  Over time, we will feature static figures such as customizable camera mounts, pivoting structures, attachments for parts storage, and dynamic assemblies (you could even call them robots).

## Data:
_data to support engineering & development_

We don't have a specific structure for posting data but as I accumulate useful drawings and reliable documentation behind the branded boxes (such as Raco by Hubbel) I will upload the content for others to download.  At times, I markup a PDF with mechanical drawings to point out the key items instead of starting a document from scratch.
