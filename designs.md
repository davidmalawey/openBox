# Design
The purpose of Handybox is to benefit several types of projects with one standard part, accompanied by several other standards that have a well-established ecosystem and many available components near you at brick-and-mortar stores.
I Hope you benefit from the concepts here - even without building any handybox designs you will find some techniques that save time in CAD, prototyping, wiring, or creating new concepts for designs.

# Parts
Components, methods, and considerations for organizing wires in projects.  It's best to watch this before you design, so you can discover parts to integrate in your project plans.

## Main Parts
Main components around which the other parts are designed.

* EMT Conduit
* Handybox electrical boxes with 1/2in knockout holes
* Switches, 22mm, toggle switches
* Outlets, ordinary 120v North America standard

## HandyMount
Mount your boxes to your DIN rail, multiple orientations & box sizes.

This bracket is parametric, with configurations shown in the animated GIF. The narrow option has 1-in spacing for the 1-gang box and the wide option matches the 1.5in spacing of the square boxes found in local stores.

## Bushing
A feature for electrical and for mechanical function

Version 1 is adapted for fixing anderson connectors into the wall of a panel.

It can be adjusted for different hole sizes, or different center features.  You may wish to use it as a grommet, or adapter for a 10mm pushbutton, or 100 other items.  The idea is that a new user gains a new function but retains the investment of the code behind the nicely made parametric part.  The feature tree is easy to navigate, so you may update the design without knowledge of all the original design considerations. (just like open source software).

# Benchmarks

## Design Catalog
Below I've attached a catlog for only the Raco design collection since it took some digging to find what I needed.  There are several other brands worth exploring but we need to start somewhere!  If you find a key resource for which you base your open source design, please let us know and we can post it here as well.

## Datasheets
Online you can find datasheets for hundreds of boxes and attachments but the first few drawings I used to build the initial models are combined in one PDF for you to grab below.
