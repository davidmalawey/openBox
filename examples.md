## Organizers
Designs for holding your toos & equipment & securing them where needed.

Below: (left) Overview of some tool holders made with HandyBox, for custom fitment of various round shank sizes.
(center) Use the box with a magnet (designed for unistrut assemblies) for storing within reach.
(right)The spacing in back of the box aligns with ordinary 1x1 inch pegboard

Or, fasten the box to a composite pegboard with the compatible screws, and still reach the fastener when the openbox is loaded.
Make a business card holder - this one has a wide section for related cards that don't fit regular business card width.

## AC Electrical
For 120v or 240v appliances with custom wires or switches

## Embedded Electronics
We will feature arduino & other MCU based projects but here's the start, with a project for car adapter & embedded power control found in a PD adapter.

## DC Power

The Car Adapter converts a power tool battery to a cigarette lighter socket.  It includes a simple cover (panel) and the handy bushing (3D Printed).

## Cable Routing

The handy bushing design holds a wire or a plug in place, such as Anderson Powerwerx connectors.   It was designed by benchmarking the similar off-the-shelf designs.  The OTS bushings work great but we gain custom features by making our own.
